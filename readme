For encoding/self-supervised part
    . we use unlabelled data
    . 

For supervised/classification part
    . if training from scratch:
        . take the checkpoint from part one and plug it into the demo.py file(in get_model())
        . execute demo.py file for 30 epochs
    . if training from intermediate checkpoint add the checkpoint on line 54(demo.py)
    . run it by executing the demo.slurm file

Final submission has the evaluation script
    . run eval.slurm file with the path of the checkpoint (line 42)
